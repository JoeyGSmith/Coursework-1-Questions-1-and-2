The file quadrature contains code that applies the composite Simpson's rule for approximating integration. This takes as input a function pointer to be integrated, the number of iterations n and the numbers the function is being integrated between, a and b, with b>a.
The file linear_algebra contains the function that performs the Biconjugate Gradient Stabilised method, which is used to find the vector x in the equation xA = b. This code works for A as a tridiagonal matrix, and takes as inputs the 3 vectors representing A, and the target vector b, and outputs the vector x.
The general file contains simple functions that are used in the other files.
